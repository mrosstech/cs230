<b>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</b>
The Gaming Room is a game development company based out of Boston, Massachusetts.  They currently have a game called Draw It or Lose It which is based loosely on on the game Pictionary.  The Gaming Room is looking to expand their Android game "Draw It or Lose It" onto other platforms by creating a web version of the game.

<b>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</b>
I feel that the analysis of the Operating Systems was very thorough.   I also really enjoyed creating the recommendations section.   I think that was backed up by the previous sections and comprehensive.

<b>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</b>
The design document acted as a gate for code development.  It forced specific thought about the planning components like the UML diagram, security, and platform recommendations.   With these things in place it is much easier to develop code which will fit the platform.

<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>
If I could go back to the document and add more to it, I would revise the recommendations section and add diagrams.   I feel that diagrams of the application architecture would help the proposal stand out and help The Gaming Room to better understand the design.

<b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b>
The users needs revolved around a few key areas; security, fun, and speed.  It is critical to consider the users needs when designing games, because the users experience is the way to getting more users of the game.   The first time a user has a negative experience, they will either stop playing or, worse, tell their friends about the bad experience.   Ensuring that the game is fast, so that the users can play effectively is critical.   It's also critical that the users login information is kept safe to ensure trust.   Finally, the game needs to be fun which in terms of programming, means that it can't crash.


<b>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</b>
I will take away a few things from this course in terms of developing software.   One, start with the design.   It helps to document decisions you've made along the way.   Another is to see if there is a framework for whatever it is you're going to be programming.   Something like DropWizard for Java API development.   The final thing I would takeaway was the value of the cloud in developing scalable and performant applications.   I would attempt to leverage cloud services first and fall back to on-prem resources where necessary.
